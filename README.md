# Zen Studio

Zen Studio is a collaborative software development environment.

At the heart of Zen Studio is an OSGi inspired plugin system that allows it to be used to develop software for a variety of platforms and languages.

## Origins

Zen Studio development began nearly a decade ago when the IndieZen developers started creating tools for game development.

The original implementation was developed using C++ and wxWidgets.  This new incarnation is written primarily in JavaScript / HTML using Node.js and Aurelia targeting the [AethOS](https://github.com/aethosio/aethos-main/blob/master/README.md) platform.
